## Renaissance counting

This directory contains xmls for the renaissance counting analysis in BEAST, which estimates synonymous and nonsynonymous substitutions throughout the evolutionary history. This can be used to calculate synonymous and nonsynonymous substitution rates when dividing the respective counts by the tree length. The analysis uses the same empirical trees as the geographic analysis.
